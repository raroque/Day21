# Day21

Day21 is an iOS app I created to help people think more positively. Inspired by the TED talk, "The happy secret to better work". By logging things such as gratitudes and positive experiences for 21 days straight, you rewire your brain to start thinking more positively! Even after the 21 days are up, you can keep using Day21 as a journal for positive thinking :)

The goal of the app is to improve mental health -> improve overall well-being.

### This used to be paid, why is it free and the code publicly available?

This was the first paid app I released to the app store, but I've made it free (you can download it [here](https://itunes.apple.com/om/app/day21/id1017649537?mt=8)). 

Day21 is now part of [Everfit](http://everfit.co), a project I started to help improve and promote overall well-being for as many people as possible. This app helped me significantly and I want it to reach as many people as possible, so I've made it free. 

I've also decided to release the code to help anyone who wants to learn to code. The best way to learn how to code is to code. Download the project and modify it as much as you want (for example, you can change the colors if the current colors don't fit your style). Fair warning, I'm still learning (and I'm not a CS major) so the style is probably not the best (I'll be going in and cleaning it from time to time). However, if you make any changes (or fix any bugs) you think would benefit everyone, let me know. I want to get better too :)

### Everfit

If you like the idea of creating things to improve the overall well-being of the world then consider contributing to [Everfit](http://everfit.co)! We are looking for people to help us build cool stuff that would help others (even if its just through a small app like this).
